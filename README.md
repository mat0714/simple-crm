# Simple CRM

## What is this?
This project is backend application for Customer Relationship Management. Main part is REST API which allows creating, reading, updating and deleting information about:
- Customer
- Company- place where customer is working
- Employee- person which will be potential users of Simple CRM and will be in contact with Customer
- Event- contact details between Employee and Customer

### Most important features
1. **Application is secured.** Some actions are allowed only by proper user. There are two types of them:
- Manager (allowed to: create, read, update and delete all entities)
- Employee (allowed to: create, read, update all entities)

2. **Project applies JSON Web Token** to securely transmit information between parties. JJWT is implemented to provide this functionality (https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt). Generated token is valid for 10 days.

3. **MySQL database is used.** All tables are generated automatically thanks to Hibernate. During first run of Simple CRM, database is populated with initial data and also database user is created: 

Username:
```
user 
```
Password:
```
password123!
```
4. **API documentation is auto-generated by Swagger.**

5. **Application uses two Spring profiles:**
- dev (when running project locally directly from IDE)
- prod (when running project in Docker containers)

6. **Project include unit and integration tests.** The scope of the tests is concentrated on "CompanyApi" and "CompanyService". There are also integration tests which checks if all layers together work properly.

## API documentation
After you run this application you can find documentation here:
```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/
```
### To try this API with Swagger you have to:
1. Send post request to the authentication endpoint with data mentioned below. You can login as manager or employee. This will determine actions which you will be able to perform. 

Login:
```
Manager or Employee
```
Password:
```
Password123
```
2. Copy the authorization header which you can find in response. It should contain JSON Web Token and looks like: "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzM4NCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJNYW5hZ2VyIiwicm9sZXMiOiJST0xFX01BTkFHRVIiLCJpYXQiOjE2NzU4NTQzMTEsImV4cCI6MTY3NjY3NDgwMH0.lz2jAhUdmdvohhRY9oa_BoI1Rbqs-MFJKsuJeaa_0xuprdPJ1BXQ5hV36dcm4Xgr"
3. Click "Authorize" and paste token in appropriate field.

After above steps you should be able to interact with endpoints and perform CRUD operations (depending on you are logged as manager or employee). You will see similar window to that which you can see below.
